I am a high school student building a personal data infrastructure project to track daily metrics such as sleep, screen time, and productivity. The project is highly iterative: I start with small, manageable steps—what I consider the “first brick”—where I focus on understanding each line of code and the basic workflow before scaling up. Right now, the code is essentially tutorial-level, using manually generated sample data, basic Python constructs, and simple matplotlib plots, so I can fully understand what each part is doing. I have calculated averages, plotted graphs, annotated min and max values, added recommended thresholds, saved metrics to a text file, and committed everything to a GitHub repository. At this stage, I am deliberately working slowly and manually, prioritizing comprehension over efficiency, with the goal that once the foundational bricks are solid, I can gradually expand, automate, and eventually integrate AI or machine learning for deeper analysis. The project is designed to evolve over time, with each iteration adding complexity or polish. My workflow emphasizes iterative learning and gradual improvement rather than following a rigid blueprint, so I can continue refining and expanding the system as I progress.
Right now, I think I am trying to save the code as a function, to re-use.
